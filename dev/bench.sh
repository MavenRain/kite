#!/bin/zsh
# dev/bench.sh NAME CMD
# Runs CMD once untimed as a warm-up, then RUNS timed runs (RUNS defaults to 5).
# CMD is one string, run as zsh -c CMD, with stdout and stderr sent to /dev/null.
# The timer is perf_counter_ns around subprocess.run, so interpreter start-up is
# outside every measurement.
# Success prints exactly one line:
#   BENCH NAME median_ms=12.345 min_ms=11.000 max_ms=14.200 runs=5
# A non-zero child exit prints BENCH-ERROR NAME exit=N and exits 1.
#
# ADAPTED from /Users/oobi/Documents/brisk/dev/bench.sh (71 lines).  The
# interface, the timer and the output line are unchanged;  only the header
# names kite.  See dev/PROVENANCE.md.
